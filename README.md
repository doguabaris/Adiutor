# Adiutor

Adiutor is a tool developed to facilitate maintenance tasks on Wikipedia, making them more efficient and user-friendly. Built using OOUI-based MediaWiki JS and JavaScript, Adiutor is designed to provide users with convenience in performing various tasks. All suggestions and bug reports are reviewed and discussed on the discussion page to continually improve and refine the tool. The active participation and support from the Wikipedia community play a vital role in further developing Adiutor into a more functional and user-friendly tool.
